            "content": "Thank you for downloading the new app to stream WPRK. Since 1952, the station has evolved to be more student-driven and reflective of the community.\n\nOur most recent change is our updated app, initially developed by former Station Manager Muse Ngoma ’23, and now taken over by Laura Boettcher ’25 and Mauricio Rodriguez ’24. The WPRK team is proud to work with these student developers, who are eager to incorporate new features.\n\nThanks to the money raised on Giving Day 2023, the team is working hard to develop a two-week archive of past shows, giving users the ability to listen to shows they may have missed. We are excited to continue innovating and introducing new features.\n\nIf you are able to support this work, please consider donating to WPRK. Thank you for listening!",

            "title": "A Chat with Chappell Roan - Debut Album Release 9/22/23!",
            "author": "Jaianne Gilkey",
            "content": "A very fun recent opportunity WPRK staff was thankful to be invited to was a press conference hosted by Universal Music Group and °1824  for “Gloriously Unserious'' Island Records Artist, Chappell Roan, before she goes on tour and releases her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess! UMG representatives share words about Chappell Roan and her journey: LA-based singer/songwriter Chappell Roan is the next multi-faceted force in pop music. Through her bold pop hooks, honest songwriting, and a heavy dose of glitter, she has the music to get you up and on the dance floor. Chappell Roan’s been praised by Rolling Stone, Vulture, DIY Mag and Pitchfork, who calls her music ‘gloriously unserious’ with ‘instantaneously memorable hooks and more than a few eyebrow-raising lines.’ In 2022, Chappell released one of her most beloved hits ‘Pink Pony Club’ a synth-pop smash about a small town girl who finds belonging at a West Hollywood go-go club. Since then, she’s gone on to open for Olivia Rodrigo and Fletcher on tours across the country. Known for her electrifying and crowd-involving performances, she curates environments for her fans to be their true selves. Now Chappell is about to release her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, on September 22. Over the past year, she has built a cult-like fanbase while teasing the album with singles like the booming ‘Red Wine Supernova’ and ‘Kaleidoscope.’ The small-town rhinestone cowgirl will also be embarking on her Midwest Princess Tour across the US and Canada. At the virtual Zoom conference on Thursday, September 7th, 2023, the pop singer/songwriter (and fabulously passionate drag enthusiast) shared inspiration and insight on her artistry with eager publications and radio stations across the US - all fans of her music, style, and personality. Chappell Roan, whose real name is Kayleigh Rose Amstutz, says that if she could choose any creatively possible way for fans to listen to her upcoming album, her most ideal setting would be something intimate that would allow people to feel free, be silly, and confidently express themselves, like a slumber party or craft night. Attendees asked questions that dove deep into Kayleigh’s connections to her songs such as, “Femininomenon”, which she reveals she originally wanted to name the album, but charmingly admitted she was afraid that people would find it too hard to pronounce. The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess will also feature her freshly released single, “HOT TO GO!” in which she gushes was heavily inspired by synth pop and 80s music and wrote it with the dance (as seen in the music video and performed on stage) already in mind. Filmed in her hometown, Chappell reveals that drag inspired the project with style and movement, and that anything camp, fun, and dramatic are go-tos for her shows and music videos. Her representation and exploration of queer relationships and struggles can be heard in her craft, as she hopes to relate and validate others’ experiences and identities in the LGBTQ+ community. WPRK is eagerly awaiting more music from Chappell Roan and are looking forward to supporting this sparkling queen as she embarks on this new era. We are ecstatic to celebrate and dance to her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, set to release September 22nd!",
