            "content": "Thank you for downloading the new app to stream WPRK. Since 1952, the station has evolved to be more student-driven and reflective of the community.\n\nOur most recent change is our updated app, initially developed by former Station Manager Muse Ngoma ’23, and now taken over by Laura Boettcher ’25 and Mauricio Rodriguez ’24. The WPRK team is proud to work with these student developers, who are eager to incorporate new features.\n\nThanks to the money raised on Giving Day 2023, the team is working hard to develop a two-week archive of past shows, giving users the ability to listen to shows they may have missed. We are excited to continue innovating and introducing new features.\n\nIf you are able to support this work, please consider donating to WPRK. Thank you for listening!",

            "title": "A Chat with Chappell Roan - Debut Album Release 9/22/23!",
            "author": "Jaianne Gilkey",
            "content": "A very fun recent opportunity WPRK staff was thankful to be invited to was a press conference hosted by Universal Music Group and °1824  for “Gloriously Unserious'' Island Records Artist, Chappell Roan, before she goes on tour and releases her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess!\n\nUMG representatives share words about Chappell Roan and her journey: \n\nLA-based singer/songwriter Chappell Roan is the next multi-faceted force in pop music. Through her bold pop hooks, honest songwriting, and a heavy dose of glitter, she has the music to get you up and on the dance floor. Chappell Roan’s been praised by Rolling Stone, Vulture, DIY Mag and Pitchfork, who calls her music ‘gloriously unserious’ with ‘instantaneously memorable hooks and more than a few eyebrow-raising lines.’ \n\nIn 2022, Chappell released one of her most beloved hits ‘Pink Pony Club’ a synth-pop smash about a small town girl who finds belonging at a West Hollywood go-go club. Since then, she’s gone on to open for Olivia Rodrigo and Fletcher on tours across the country. Known for her electrifying and crowd-involving performances, she curates environments for her fans to be their true selves. \n\nNow Chappell is about to release her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, on September 22. Over the past year, she has built a cult-like fanbase while teasing the album with singles like the booming ‘Red Wine Supernova’ and ‘Kaleidoscope.’ The small-town rhinestone cowgirl will also be embarking on her Midwest Princess Tour across the US and Canada.\n\nAt the virtual Zoom conference on Thursday, September 7th, 2023, the pop singer/songwriter (and fabulously passionate drag enthusiast) shared inspiration and insight on her artistry with eager publications and radio stations across the US - all fans of her music, style, and personality. Chappell Roan, whose real name is Kayleigh Rose Amstutz, says that if she could choose any creatively possible way for fans to listen to her upcoming album, her most ideal setting would be something intimate that would allow people to feel free, be silly, and confidently express themselves, like a slumber party or craft night.\n\nAttendees asked questions that dove deep into Kayleigh’s connections to her songs such as, “Femininomenon”, which she reveals she originally wanted to name the album, but charmingly admitted she was afraid that people would find it too hard to pronounce. The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess will also feature her freshly released single, “HOT TO GO!” in which she gushes was heavily inspired by synth pop and 80s music and wrote it with the dance (as seen in the music video and performed on stage) already in mind. Filmed in her hometown, Chappell reveals that drag inspired the project with style and movement, and that anything camp, fun, and dramatic are go-tos for her shows and music videos. \n\nHer representation and exploration of queer relationships and struggles can be heard in her craft, as she hopes to relate and validate others’ experiences and identities in the LGBTQ+ community. WPRK is eagerly awaiting more music from Chappell Roan and are looking forward to supporting this sparkling queen as she embarks on this new era. We are ecstatic to celebrate and dance to her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, set to release September 22nd!",

            "title": "Movements makes their long awaited return to Tampa on the ruckus tour",
            "author": "Nicole Hayek",
            "content": "California based band Movements, consisting of Patrick Miranda, Ira George, Spencer York and Adam Cressy, took the stage last Saturday in Tampa, Florida. Performing a total of 18 songs, from start to finish the energy in the crowd and onstage was indescribable.\n\nThe stage was completely dark when they began with the song “You’re One of Us Now” from their new album, the crowd reacted immediately like the song had been a long term classic. Following it up was one of the first singles of the album, “Lead Pipe”. The energy on stage was electric, and was definitely felt by the crowd as they were screaming the lyrics at a volume I did not know was possible. “Colorblind” , a fan favorite, screamed at the top of everyone’s lungs in the crowd, and the band’s energy was absolutely incredible.\n\nThroughout the night, their well-crafted setlist consisted of tracks from their new album “Ruckus”, fan-favorites, and tracks from their 2017 album “Feel Something”. You could tell by the reactions to these songs, the time that was put into this setlist was definitely not overlooked by the crowd. Especially for the addition of the song “Dance With Death”, which was not on the original setlist, was a pleasant surprise for the crowd that night.\n\nA little over halfway through the set, the song “Fever Dream” was played in which Patrick was only accompanied by their lead guitarist Ira, in playing the incredibly sad song acoustically. Throughout the crowd, there was a huge energy shift as the crowd practically fell silent, just wanting to hear Patrick’s voice with only certain parts of the crowd singing along.\n\nFollowing “Fever Dream”, they played the track “Killing Time” which was a stark contrast to the previous song on stage. Almost like nothing happened, fans wiped off their tears and picked the energy back up almost immediately which had to be felt by the band as well, as their energy also was at an all time high during this point in the set.\n\nA perfect close to the whole night, the final song that was played was the song “Daylily”. A song that live somehow feels like a massive group hug between the stage and the crowd. All singing with each other “I think it’s time you had a pink cloud summer” echoed through the just over a thousand people in attendance that night. A very emotional track for sure, as it felt like you were screaming the lyrics on a long ride home with your friends, except instead of your friends it was being in a room with a thousand strangers.\n\nAn unforgettable night, Movements is an incredible band that I would definitely recommend seeing live. They are currently on the Ruckus Tour with Mannequin P—-, Softcult and Heart to Gold until they wrap up the end of their tour in Anaheim October 15th.",

I decided to take on this role due to my love for music and because I wanted to become more involved on campus. Music is my favorite way to bond with new people, and I think with coming into a new environment at Rollins I would love to find others with similar interests. \n\nI am so excited to work at the station and to get involved with music club and other forms of student media. Some of my all-time favorite artists include Fleetwood Mac, Mazzy Star, and The Sundays. I also enjoy a multitude of other forms of media, and I adore the Orlando scene.
