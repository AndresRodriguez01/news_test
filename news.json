            "author": "Greg Golden",
            "content": "Thank you for downloading the new app to stream WPRK. Since 1952, the station has evolved to be more student-driven and reflective of the community.\n\nOur most recent change is our updated app, initially developed by former Station Manager Muse Ngoma ’23, and now taken over by Laura Boettcher ’25 and Mauricio Rodriguez ’25. The WPRK team is proud to work with these student developers, who are eager to incorporate new features.\n\nThanks to the money raised on Giving Day 2023, the team is working hard to develop a two-week archive of past shows, giving users the ability to listen to shows they may have missed. We are excited to continue innovating and introducing new features.\n\nIf you are able to support this work, please consider donating to WPRK. Thank you for listening!"
